# Project Name
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- The company wants to know,which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and how well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Business Goal : Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables
- We also have a Data Dictionary for our refrence for better understanding of the variables used in the dataset.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We were able to build a Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction
- Regularization techniques ar also used for tuning the model
- We were able to extract some interesting insights from this dataset.
- Difference between train R-Squared & test R-Squared value is below 5% which implies no Overfitting and the model is working fine both for train and test data.
